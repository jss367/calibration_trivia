# Calibration Trivia

## TODO

Separate the questioner view from the answerer view

add a consensus score or something.

allow teams?

single player vs group version?

Log in to a particular session? That way everyone around you can do consensus scoring with only people from that session and not worry about mixing with other sessions.

Fix behavior when people don't select an answer.

Explain brier score, what scores are good.

Don't say "you were wrong" every time.

Say the number of times someone guessed. You were correct 40% of the time (2/5).

Some way to avoid repeaated questions between sessions?
